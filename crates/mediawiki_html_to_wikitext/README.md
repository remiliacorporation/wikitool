# MediaWiki HTML to wikitext

`mediawiki_html_to_wikitext` is the deterministic DOM-rendering layer used by preservation and
import companions. It converts retained HTML structure into conservative MediaWiki primitives,
routes same-origin links through a caller-supplied target, binds media only through a separately
verified inventory, and composes independently versioned source and target profiles.

A source profile owns source identity, article/media routes, ordinary table classes, and observed
source-side semantics. A target profile owns link routing, output bounds, and the admitted template
vocabulary. Only the profiled compiler may join a source semantic such as an infobox-shaped table
to a target template. Other classified tables are returned as typed `unmapped_structures`, so
corpus expansion informs deliberate target-template design instead of cloning source templates.
Infobox interpretation is source-declared: the table class, title-row class, and observed field
layout are profile data rather than site-specific constants in the converter.
Admitted source message-box classes map only through a target-declared message template and
parameter vocabulary. Unlabeled infobox content uses an explicit target content parameter rather
than a fabricated label, and unlabeled audio derives its accessible label from captured source
filenames rather than generating article prose.

For single-cell labelled infoboxes, actual labelled entries fill the target's
numbered fields. Notes, navigation and field overflow use its explicit continuation
parameter in source order. Line breaks are not treated as an estimate of field
count. A target without a continuation parameter refuses that content rather than
dropping it or inventing numbered fields beyond the declared interface.

Generic webpage adaptation is semantic, not visual replication. A source profile may select one
meaningful content root, discard source-specific chrome or animation regions with explicit CSS
selectors, remove hidden duplicates, and drop embedded app elements. Every profiled compile requires
a strict `mediawiki.html-capture-receipt.v1` that binds the exact HTML bytes, source identity,
canonical and final URLs, capture time, static-HTML or rendered-DOM representation, producer claim,
JavaScript-execution claim, timeout, and evidence bounds. The producer fields are caller-reported
provenance, not authenticated proof of the acquisition environment.

The result reports separate counts for discarded style, script, interaction, hidden, and
profile-selected structures, plus bounded typed observations for inline and external CSS and
JavaScript. Inline observations retain only hashes and byte counts; safe external observations retain
declared and resolved locators, media or script type, a narrow classification, and a non-application
or non-execution disposition. Invalid, unsupported-scheme, credential-bearing, or overlong locators
are rejected or reduced to a hash and typed status rather than echoed. The compiler does not fetch
external resource bodies, apply CSS, or execute JavaScript. When script execution is necessary to
expose authored content, an acquisition or browser layer must provide the bounded rendered DOM and
receipt before conversion. Durable text, media, captions, links, and informational states are then
projected through the target profile's MediaWiki primitives and admitted template vocabulary.

The crate does not acquire pages, decode a producer bundle, choose site templates, emit a
publication receipt, or write to a wiki. Those authorities belong to callers. Producer-specific
bundle decoding and Remilia's profile files stay outside the crate while the profile schemas and
conversion mechanics remain reusable and dogfoodable.
